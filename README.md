## Description
Many high school students run into a dilemma upon graduation. They don't know where to even begin when trying to select a college major.
And it is not just graduating high school students; according to the National Center for Education Studies, 30% of college students in 
undergraduate programs had changed their major at least once and 10% of undergraduate students changed their major two or more times.

In order to help these student make better, well informed decisions, our group has set out to create a tool to aid in this decision making
process.

## About the Shinyapp
The app contains both descriptive and predictive analysis. 

On the first two pages (Explore and Compare), the user can see many different charts and graphs that explain what is going on with the data.  A user can compare the rates between salary and employment rate, for example. 

Another thing the user will be able to do is receive a recommendation for which college major category they should select. This is followed up by a list of majors in that category for the user to select from.
